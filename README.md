# MLP-Face-Recognition
Face Recognition using Neural network

Here in this project, we present a simple Face recognition system based on a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP).
To run this project, go to "FaceApp.m" file and run it and follow the following instructions:

1. Firstly, you should extract train images in the folder called "ORLimgs" and the same thing in the folder called "ORLTestimgs", where we should extract the test files.

2. After that, to start the training process, we click on "Training Dataset":

3. We click on "Test Dataset" to get the accuracy value result.
4. From the "Face Recognition" button, we can load one image per time and get the ID result based on the trained model.
